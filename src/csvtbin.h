/******************************************************************************

    The format of the .tbin compressed analog magnetic tape data file

This describes a file format that is more general that what is implemented.
The current code supports only one data block with 16-bit non-delta samples.

// What follows are multiple sets of "ntrks" packed little-endian signed integers,
// in the track (head) order msb..lsb,parity.
// Each integer is "sample_bits" long, and encodes the read head voltage for a sample in the range
// -maxvolts..+maxvolts by -(2^sample_bits-1)-1..+2^(sample_bits-1)-1, rounded to the closest integer.
//    (For sample_bits=16, that's -32767..+32767.)
// To mark the end is the single value -2^(sample_bits-1), which is outside that range.
//    (For sample_bits=16, that's -32768, or 0x8000.)
// After that there can (in theory) be more tbin_dat structures, or the end of the file.

// portability assumptions not otherwise explicit in the types:
//  - numeric fields are externally stored as little-endian, and are converted when necessary
//  - an enum is 4 bytes, and values are sequentially numbered from 0 unless specified otherwise
//  - a float is 4 bytes in single-precision IEEE 754 format
//  - the datetime struct tm is the Unix standard nine 4-byte integers (36 bytes):
//    sec, min, hour, day, month, year since 1900, weekday, days since Jan 1, DST flag
