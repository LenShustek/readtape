the output files will be "results\132_pt1.xxx"

.tbin file header:
  -order=mClLcM
  the waveforms were inverted by CSVTBIN

  max voltage: 4.0V
  time between samples: 3.840 usec
  using .tbin mode = Whirlwind

no .parms file was found, so we're using these internal defaults for the Whirlwind parameter sets:
  parms      active, clk_window,  clk_alpha, agc_window,  agc_alpha,   min_peak,pkww_bitfrac,  pkww_rise,  id
  {            1,          0,      0.050,          0,      0.500,      1.000,      0.400,      0.200,   PRM}

compile-time decoding constants:
  peak height closeness threshold: 0.005V
  nominal peak height for rise calculation: 2.0V
  AGC maximum: 2
  Whirlwind clock stop detect time: 1.5 bits

starting preprocessing to determine head skew...

execution-time configuration:
  we set ntrks=6 as implied by the -order string "mClLcM"
  6 track Whirlwind encoding, no parity, 100 BPI at 50 IPS (200.00 usec/bit)
  first sample is at time 2.3108877 seconds on the tape
  sampling rate is 260,416 Hz (3.84 usec), or about 52 samples per bit
  peak detection window width is 20 samples (76.80 usec)
  Whirlwind data has 6 tracks from 6 data heads assigned as follows:
    track 1, head 1 is the  primary clk, 'C'
    track 3, head 3 is the  primary LSB, 'L'
    track 5, head 5 is the  primary MSB, 'M'
    track 4, head 4 is the  alternate clk, 'c'
    track 2, head 2 is the  alternate LSB, 'l'
    track 0, head 0 is the  alternate MSB, 'm'
  the initial peak polarity for each flux change will be automatically determined for each block

  the flux direction was set to negative based on a peak on track 3 at time 2.3118246

head skew compensation after reading the first 15 blocks:
  track 0 delayed by 7 clocks (26.88 usec) based on 848 observed flux transitions
  track 1 delayed by 16 clocks (61.44 usec) based on 4381 observed flux transitions
  track 2 delayed by 5 clocks (19.20 usec) based on 1179 observed flux transitions
  track 3 delayed by 10 clocks (38.40 usec) based on 1179 observed flux transitions
  track 4 delayed by 4 clocks (15.36 usec) based on 4390 observed flux transitions
  track 5 delayed by 0 clocks (0.00 usec) based on 848 observed flux transitions
  the earliest peak is 197.84 usec, and the latest peak is 257.44 usec
  that peak difference of 59.61 usec, and the largest standard deviation of 3.66 usec, are 29.8% and 1.8% of the nominal bit spacing
  created statistics file "results\132_pt1.peakstats_deskew.csv" from 12,825 measurements of flux transition positions
  to graph it from Excel, open the CSV file, then: insert chart 2D line
