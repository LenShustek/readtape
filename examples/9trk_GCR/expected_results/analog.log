compile-time decoding constants:
  minimum excursion before considering a zero crossing: 0.200V
  maximum time in bits for the required excursion to be attained: 1.5 bit times
  AGC maximum: 2
  GCR idle threshold: 6.00 bits
  derived ntrks=9 from .CSV file header
BPI was reset to 9042 for GCR 6250

execution-time configuration:
  9 track GCR encoding, odd parity, 9042 BPI at 125 IPS (0.88 usec/bit)
  first sample is at time 0.86054032 seconds on the tape
  sampling rate is 12,500,000 Hz (0.08 usec), or about 11 samples per bit
  will look for zero crossings, not peaks
  input data order: 0(msb)1234567(lsb)p

creating file "analog.tap"
creating file "analog.ASCII.txt"
wrote block   1, 10000 bytes, 1 try, parmset 0, max AGC 1.00, ok, avg speed 124.20 IPS at time 0.87416216, tap offset 8
wrote block   2, 10000 bytes, 1 try, parmset 0, max AGC 1.00, ok, avg speed 124.46 IPS at time 0.88991032, tap offset 10016
analog.tap was closed at time 0.89101192 after 20,000 data bytes were extracted from 2 blocks

summary for file "analog.csv":
  380,897 samples were processed in 0 seconds (0.000 seconds/block)
  created 1 output file with a total of 20,020 bytes
  decoded 0 tape marks and 2 blocks with 20,000 bytes from 0.02 seconds of tape data
   the last block written was 0.88991032 seconds into the tape
  0 blocks had errors, 0 had warnings, 0 had mismatched tracks, 0 had bits corrected

  created statistics file "analog.peakstats.csv" from 165,150 measurements of flux transition positions
  to graph it from Excel, open the CSV file, then: insert chart 2D line
  the earliest peak is 1.35 usec, and the latest peak is 1.42 usec
  that peak difference of 0.08 usec, and the largest standard deviation of 0.55 usec, are 8.9% and 62.4% of the nominal bit spacing
  head skew is significant; you should try again with the -deskew option
